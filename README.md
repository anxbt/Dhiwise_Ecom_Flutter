### Check the UI of the entire app

Check the UI of all the app screens from a single place by setting up the 'initialRoute'  to AppNavigation in the AppRoutes.dart file.

### Application structure
After successful build, your application structure should look like this:
                    
```
.
├── android                         - It contains files required to run the application on an Android platform.
├── assets                          - It contains all images and fonts of your application.
├── ios                             - It contains files required to run the application on an iOS platform.
├── lib                             - Most important folder in the application, used to write most of the Dart code..
    ├── main.dart                   - Starting point of the application
    ├── core
    │   ├── app_export.dart         - It contains commonly used file imports
    │   ├── constants               - It contains static constant class file
    │   └── utils                   - It contains common files and utilities of the application

### How to format your code?

- if your code is not formatted then run following command in your terminal to format code
  ```
  dart format .
  ```

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your Flutter project:

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine:

```
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. **Navigate into the project directory**:

```
cd <project_directory>
```

3. **Install dependencies**:

```
flutter pub get
```

4. **Run the app**:

```
flutter run
```

This command will build and run your Flutter app on a connected device or emulator.

## Project Structure

The Flutter project structure is as follows:

- **`android/`**: Contains the Android-specific code for your app.
- **`ios/`**: Contains the iOS-specific code for your app.
- **`lib/`**: Contains the Dart code for your app.
  - **`main.dart`**: Entry point for your Flutter app.
